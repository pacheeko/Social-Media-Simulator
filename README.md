# Social Media Simulator

Includes a client peer which first connects to the main server to collect other peer data. Then periodically sends peer data to all known active peers. The client also has the functionality to send snippets to other peers, and to print out a report of all information recieved. When a stop messaged is recieved, it re-connects to the main server to issue the report of all information recieved.
